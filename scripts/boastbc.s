# Boasts and Retorts
# ==================
# Homer's Iliad is full of of warriors trading speeches before single combat.
# They boast of their ancestry and strength and mock the other man's.
# E.G. Aeneas and Achilles do it at length before fighting in Book 20, and Aeneas even says they could trade insults all day.
#
# Set with a side-order of swashbuckling metaphor, you will battle the pirates 4 (or more) times,
# each battle more intense that the last.
# Remember the boasts thrown out by the pirates, and pick the correct retort from those you have learned.
# To learn the retorts, use the boasts you can remember, and learn the corrrect retort (probably).
# A good retort will win a point; a bad retort will give a point to the boaster.
# The exact rules are different for each round, but the pattern is consistent.
# In round #4 you will meet the Captain, he has different boasts,
# but each can be beaten by a retort you (may have) learned from a crewman.  [qv. data/boasts.txt]
# If you missed a crewman retort, the only way to learn it now is by using the Captain's boast back at him.
# The Captain is never wrong, so you cannot "beat" the Captain per-se, and retort badly, even once, and you will lose.
# However, if you stand your ground long enough, he will acknowledge your guile, and you will "win"
